## Project Structure

- **utils**: Contains utility functions for tasks like obtaining access tokens, getting location information, and time conversion.
- **components**: Reusable React components for different parts of the application.
- **services**: API service for fetching weather data.

## Usage

1. Clone the project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arifmia1129/Weather-Pulse.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd Weather-Pulse
   npm install
   ```

3. **Important Note**: Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following line, replacing `accessTokenFromOpenWeather` with your OpenWeatherMap API access token:

   ```env
   TOKEN=accessTokenFromOpenWeather
   ```

4. Run the project:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the Weather Pulse dashboard.

## Location Handling

- The application prompts for location access on the first visit. If allowed, it shows weather information based on the user's current location.
- If a user previously set a location, it retrieves and displays weather information for that location.
- If location access is blocked, the default weather information is based on the system's default location.

## Contributing

Feel free to open issues, contribute to the project, or provide feedback.

## Disclaimer

Due to the limitations of the free API, the project uses hourly forecast data instead of daily forecasts.
